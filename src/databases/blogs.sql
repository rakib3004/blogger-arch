The state of the store can only be modified by dispatching \"actions\", which are plain JavaScript objects that describe the changes to be made to the state. When an action is dispatched, it is sent to a \"reducer\", which is a pure function that takes the current state and the action as input, and returns the new state of the application.\n\nThe Redux architecture is based on three main principles:\n\nSingle source of truth: The state of the whole application is stored in a single store.\n\nState is read-only: The only way to change the state is by dispatching an action.\n\nChanges are made with pure functions: The reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action and return the new state of the application.\n\nBy following these principles, Redux provides a predictable and easy-to-understand way to manage the state of an application. This makes it easier to debug and test the application, and also makes it more scalable as the complexity of the application grows.\n\nIn addition to the store, actions, and reducers, Redux also provides middleware, which is a way to add extra functionality to the dispatch process. Middleware can be used for things like logging, asynchronous actions, and more.\n\nOverall, Redux is a powerful and widely-used library for managing the state of complex JavaScript applications.
